      explanation: "This one is a bit tricky. There are two potential correct answers, yet only one is the most direct as a reply to the question that the male inquirer asks: 'Is that the suit you've chosen for this speech?' The inquirer references 'the suit' and the correct answer also references 'the suit' as 'it' AND the woman also responds as if the male inquirer is looking at the suit that she's currently wearing: 'Yes, it's the only clean one I have.' The only other possible option is, 'Yes, it's always kept in the same place.' This reply references the suit as 'it' again, but is not as direct of an answer since the inquirer never asked about where the suit is kept and it seems odd as an additional salient detail that the woman adds as part of her reply."

      audio: "35_toeic1_daniela_vo_DONE.mp3",
      explanation: "'Her shift is up soon.' The phrase 'shift is up soon' means that the woman is 'getting off work soon'. Hence, the answer, 'She can carpool home with us right after if she wants.', seems like the best and most direct response to the initial statement, especially since it can be assumed that the two parties chatting actually work with the woman who they're discussing and that they're all currently at the same workplace. The phrase 'carpool home with us' means that 'one person can drive one or more other co-workers home to save money on gas and car wear-and-tear.' Or maybe before the recorded section of the conversation, they discussed how the woman in question took the bus or walked to work that day or regularly. Therefore, it would make even more sense that he and his friends would offer to carpool to get her home even faster."

      question:

      choices: ["A) delegates", "B) delegate", "C) delegated", "D) decorate"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      image: "img/101-140.png",
      explanation: "The correct answer is: 'delegate'. The clearest evidence is that the subject is singular and the phrase 'how to' precedes the word in question. The word 'decorate' doesn't make grammatical sense because one doesn't 'decorate to' something, yet he instead 'decorates' something. Lastly, the word 'delegate' refers to 'a supervisor or manager giving someone else responsibility over duties or tasks'. Therefore, the word makes clearest sense in the context of the sentence."

      correctAnswer: 1,
      image: "img/101-140.png",
      explanation: "The phrase 'grow by acquisition' is common in the business world and makes sense in the context of this sentence. If a company grows by 'acquisition', it means that the company 'buys many competitors to garner their intellectual property and/or effective systems and/or customer list and/or employees.' The phrase 'grow by acquihire' may have been correct if and only if the last part of the sentence exclusively emphasized attracting and hiring exemplary employees from all of the purchased businesses."

A 'product' is something that a company produces (or gets produced by a third-party), markets (or gets marketed by a third-party), and sells to customers (or gets sold to customers by a third-party).

      explanation: "The phrase 'voted to oust their CEO' is the only one that makes sense when considering the other word choices. The word 'out' seems like it could make sense, yet the description of the evidence that the CEO 'was actively trying to sabotage the company' is a situation where most companies would try to quickly get rid of the CEO ('oust') as opposed to simply tell the media and/or other potentially interested parties what's going on ('out'). Hence, the word 'oust' is clearly the best answer here."

      question:
        "The entire team went out and enjoyed a delicious and healthy lunch together. ________, we made a pact to work extra-hard during the upcoming holiday season even if it meant some overtime and early mornings.",
      choices: ["A) Whatsoever", "B) Despite this", "C) Moreso", "D) Obviously"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      image: "img/101-140.png",
      explanation: "The two possible options are 'Despite this' and 'Moreso'. Let's tackle each one. First, let's plug in 'Despite this' in the blank space: 'The entire team went out and enjoyed a delicious and healthy lunch together. Despite this, we each made a pact to work extra-hard during the upcoming holiday season even if it meant some overtime and early mornings.' This makes somewhat logical and grammatical sense, yet it seems a bit of an odd emphasis to focus on. For example, the emphasis was on the fact that the co-workers 'enjoyed a delicious and healthy lunch together', but that it was perhaps a negative that they were taking time off for lunch and enjoying their lunch break together as 'Despite this' reflects opposite counter-point scenarios presented in each sentence. Now let's try filling the blank with 'Moreso': 'The entire team went out and enjoyed a delicious and healthy lunch together. Moreso, we each made a pact to work extra-hard during the upcoming holiday season even if it meant some overtime and early mornings.' This makes the most logical and grammatical sense because the emphasis is on the bonds of the co-workers and that they are connecting and bonding whether they are working diligently or sharing a lunch setting together. The word 'Moreso' emphasizes the team's connectedness and communicativeness on this particular day and is the best answer."

      correctAnswer: 2,
      image: "img/101-140.png",
      explanation: "The only word that makes sense here is 'demoted'. A company would not be deciding between promotion (someone getting a higher-ranking job with more prestige and/or income within the company) and termination (firing someone). Rather, the company would be deciding between demotion (someone getting a lower-ranking job with less prestige and/or income within the company) and termination (firing someone).

      choices: ["A) inferior", "B) superior", "C) compared", "D) comparison"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      image: "img/101-140.png",
      explanation: "The word 'superior' makes logical sense here because the word 'moreover' is a word that introduces evidence that supports the evidence laid out in the previous sentence or independent clause ('Our product is superior to theirs;'). A synonym of 'moreover' is 'additionally'. Hence, the correct answer is 'superior' since a product that is 'cheaper' and 'better for the environment' are all similarly positive and can all be logically connected via the word 'moreover'."

      choices: ["A) moreover", "B) however", "C) despite", "D) therefore"],
      correctAnswer: 1,
      image: "img/101-140.png",
      explanation: "The correct answer in this problem is 'however'. The chief reason is that the idea posited in the first part of the sentence ('Most economists don\'t agree on much...') contrasts the idea posited in the second half of the sentence ('they all agree that...'). The word 'despite' is similar to 'however', but the phrase ought to be 'despite this' or something similar in order for the sentence to make grammatical sense. Therefore, the correct answer is: 'however'."
